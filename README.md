## Features

- Implementation of core data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, Trees, Maps, and Sets.
- Classic algorithm implementations: Sorting, Searching, DFS, BFS, Recursion examples, and String algorithms.
- Clean, well-commented JavaScript code for easy understanding.
- Practical approach suitable for interviews and academic learning.

## Upcoming: DSA Patterns & 30-Day Challenge

### DSA Pattern Files

Soon, this repository will include a dedicated **Patterns** folder containing implementations and explanations of common algorithmic problem-solving patterns such as:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- And more...

These pattern files will help you recognize, understand, and apply fundamental techniques used repeatedly across a wide range of coding problems.

### 30-Day DSA Pattern Challenge

Alongside, a **30-Day DSA Pattern Challenge** will be introduced to help you build problem-solving skills systematically.

- Each day will focus on a key pattern with example problems.
- Problems will progress from easy to complex.
- Solutions will include detailed explanations and code.
- Ideal for interview prep and strengthening algorithmic thinking.

Stay tuned for updates and start your journey towards mastering DSA patterns with hands-on practice!
